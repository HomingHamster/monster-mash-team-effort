We started this week’s meeting by looking at both GUI designs which Ben Brooks and Aiman Arafat had developed. The group agreed we are going to put both GUI designs in the project plan document and then explain that we are going to take ideas from both GUI’s and develop them to create a main GUI for the game.
\newline
\newline
The group then discussed group standards and how we would have to agree with other groups regarding factors such as will two players have to be online to request/accept or decline a fight or can it be done if one player is offline. James Slater then brought up the standard meeting which is at 2pm tomorrow in C55. Chris Arom agreed to attend. ACTION: {\em cki}
