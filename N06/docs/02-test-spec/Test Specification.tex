\section{Introduction} 
\subsection{Purpose of the Document}
The purpose of this document will be to establish any defects or flaws which may exist within our Monster Mash application, and whether the features of the application are going to be functional and operable for the user. Our testing document will explore all features and actions that can be carried out within the application and identify possible problems or errors which the user could experience. 
\subsection{Scope}
The testing specification is split up into separate tables which represent each feature or action of the game and identifies the test content, input, output and pass criteria of each test. These features include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Login/Edit Account Details Tests
\item Homepage/Friends List Tests
\item Battle Screen Test
\item Farm Test
\item Shop Test
\end{itemize}
It is important that this document is read by all members of the project group, especially the Design and Testing team.
\subsection{Objectives}
The objectives of this document are:
\begin{itemize}
\item To identify any errors, liabilities and flaws that a user may encounter when interacting with the Monster Mash application. 
\item To show these weaknesses and defects in the format of tables where the features of the Monster Mash game are thoroughly tested and certified to ensure they operate successfully. 
\item To show the test content, input, output, pass criteria and general comments of each test.
\end{itemize}

\section{Test Tables} 
\subsection{Login/Edit Account Tests} 
To test that our Login works we will have already have saved two users into our database to allow us to carry out extensive testing on the Login and account features. They will each have a username and password and we will run various tests on these users to test that the interface and server handles the information entered as we would expect.
\subsection{Created Users Details}
John - Username: John87 Password: computer
\\
Gareth - Username: Gaz19 Password: monster
\newpage
\section{Creating an account}
To test our registration system works we will create a user. If this test successful the username and password of the created user will be stored in the database and user will be able to Login.\\

\section{Shop Tests} 
The following tests will be featuring the Shop aspect of the Monster Mash application. The Shop will only be accessible to registered users. Users will then be presented with a menu which has the following options; Monster Farm, Shop and a Friends list. Within the Shop category the user will be presented with a variety of options. 
The main purpose of the shop is to allow the user to Buy and Sell monsters using V-Money that they have gained from battles. Users can Buy monsters from the Shop which will then be added to their Monster Farm and the price in which the monster is worth will be deducted from the users V-Money total. The user will also be able to Sell monsters which they own and the price in which the monsters are worth is calculated by taking into account the monsters statistics. If the user sells a monster, the monster will be removed from the users Monster Farm and the correct amount of currency added to the users V-Money total. It is worth mentioning that tests will be carried out using a preloaded database of monsters to avoid the user having no monsters to Buy/Sell. The final feature of the Shop will be the display of the users V-Money which will show how much currency the user has to spend within the Shop.
